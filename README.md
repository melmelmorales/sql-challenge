# Module 9 Challenge: SQL Challenge
Presented by Melissa Morales

The "EmployeeSQL" folder contains all relevant files.

## Data folder

I imported eight .csv files from the “csv files” folder into the SQL database; the files are departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, and titles.csv.

## ERDs folder

The "ERDs" folder contains the Entity Relationship Diagrams of the tables.
